# Product Philosophy

Zcout is built around a simple interaction loop:

```text
duel → decision → crowd reveal → next duel
```

The frontend is intentionally optimized for:

- immediate interaction,
- minimal onboarding,
- fast feedback,
- low cognitive load,
- continuous curiosity loops.

The goal is to make football scouting feel interactive and alive rather than static.
